# Week 05 - To Do List Challenge

**Author:** Peter C. Matthews

This repository contains my submission for the [Master Coding](https://wearecodenation.com/2022/04/25/master-coding/) course at *CodeNation*.

## Brief

**The Challenge:**
Your challenge is to create a to-do list using React. This challenge is designed to test your React skills in making components, mapping data out, managing your state and receiving user input.

**Requirements:**
 - Your app must have more than one component.
 - Add items to the list.
 - Delete items from the list.
 - Check items as done.

**Stretch Goals:**
 - Edit items.
 - Archive items from the main list to a secondary list.

Visually this project is completely down to your choice! So get creative, and look around at existing to-do list applications, and designs
