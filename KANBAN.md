# Kanban

Kanban is a popular project management methodology that helps teams to visualise, track and manage their work more effectively. It is based on the principles of continuous improvement and the efficient use of resources. Kanban boards typically use cards or sticky notes to represent individual tasks, which are then organised into columns that represent different stages of the workflow.

This visual representation of work allows teams to quickly see what needs to be done, what is in progress, and what has been completed. By limiting the amount of work in progress and continuously improving the process, teams can increase productivity, reduce waste, and deliver projects more efficiently.

**Definition of Done**

A Definition of Done (DoD) is a clear and concise description of what constitutes a finished task or project. It is an agreed-upon set of criteria that must be met in order for work to be considered complete. Having a DoD helps to ensure that everyone involved in the project has the same understanding of what is expected and helps to prevent misunderstandings or incomplete work.

For this project, the *Definition of Done* is as follows:

 - The feature has been fully implemented, and tested, to ensure functionality and accuracy.
 - The code has been reviewed and meets established standards.
 - User interface design is consistent and adheres to the project's style guide.
 - Code is documented for future reference and maintainability.
 - The feature has been pushed to its own branch, and a merge pull request issued.
 - The code has been merged into the `main` branch of the project's GitHub repository.
 - Any necessary documentation or release notes have been created and published.

Once everything in this list has been ticked ff, the task can been moved to the "Done" column on this Kanban board.
